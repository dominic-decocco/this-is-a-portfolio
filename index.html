		<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
		<pre>
Bachelor in Economics but passionate
about Graphic Design. First introduced
to Photoshop and Illustrator in the early
days of college. Self-taught and fast learner, 
I started my own App at 24, and months later reached
to JavaScript, HTML and CSS in order to enhance it.

Merging the skills of a designer and front-end developer
allows me to cover almost every base on the client side.

Currently getting involved with React Native and
3D modeling. Living in Dublin but looking foward
to moving to Spain or Portugal 

Brazilian, 28 years old, can’t settle until
the perfect font is found. </pre>

					<div>In the last year of college, my flatmate and I started a website gathering all information about our city's restaurant and bars, always highlighting the discounts: June 16th, 2016 Tumpero was live as the first gastronomic city guide.

					<div>A quick and seamless way to make that transition was to use a platform called GoodBarber to create the App. Even though it delivered what we needed to start, our new ideas became limited by the platform's features. <br><br>I had to reach for HTML, CSS and JS in order to tweak and improve Tumpero the way we wanted. A couple of months later, I was splitting my work hours into graphic design and front-end development<span> <br><br>2/6 • Actual in-app screenshots</span></div>
					
					<div>I was in charge of the creative process and its implementation through coding. The branding, logo, the design behind the app and social media content were all under my umbrella. <br><br>However, my absolute passion was the poster design for some of our campaigns. The freedom to choose any creative direction and later seeing a huge print of your work on the street is just incredibly satisfying to me <br><br><span>3/6 • Poster for an ad campaign direct to college freshmen</span></div>
					
					<div>After seeing how we handled our social media, many clients became interested in giving their own establishments a more professional approach. <br><br>So we started a secondary project to create content and manage some of the restaurant's social media, through on-site-photo shoots, menu and logo re-design and directed marketing campaigns. In August, 2017 we had to hire two interns to keep our client's social media feed updated.<br><br><span>4/6 • Voucher coupon at one of our clients, retrievable only by the App </span></div>

					<div>At the end of 2017 - with 4 team members - we reached the mark of 100 establishments signed to the App and the data feedback continued to surpass our expectations: <br><br>In December we had 15,772 sessions, 102,659 pageviews and 1,732 downloads with an average visit duration of 4 minutes. <br><br><span>5/6 • Monthly data report</span></div>
					
					<div>Although we've always had big plans for Tumpero, in 2018 our priorities became to shift towards moving to Europe, so we had to discontinue the project in September that year. <br><br>To this day, I can honestly say that Tumpero is my proudest achievement, especially for being a twenty-something entrepreneur at the time.
