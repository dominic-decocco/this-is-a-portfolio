		<h3>PR<span>O</span>FILE</h3>
		<p>
		Bachelor in Economics but passionate
		about Graphic Design. First introduced

		I started my own App at 24, and months later reached

		Merging the skills of a designer and front-end developer
		allows me to cover almost every base on the client side. <br> <br>

		Currently getting involved with React Native and
		3D modeling. Living in Dublin but looking foward
		to <br>moving to Spain or Portugal.  <br> <br>

		Brazilian, 28 years old, can’t settle until <br>

					<div>In the last year of college, my flatmate and I started a website gathering all information about our city's restaurant and bars, always highlighting the discounts: June 16th, 2016 Tumpero was live as the first gastronomic city guide.

					<div>A quick and seamless way to make that transition was to use a platform called GoodBarber to create the App. Even though it delivered what we needed to start, our new ideas became limited by the platform's features. <br><br>I had to reach for HTML, CSS and JS in order to tweak and improve Tumpero the way we wanted. A couple of months later, I was splitting my work hours into graphic design and front-end development<span> <br><br>2/6 • Actual in-app screenshots</span></div>
					
					<div>I was in charge of the creative process and its implementation through coding. The branding, logo, the design behind the app and social media content were all under my umbrella. <br><br>However, my absolute passion was the poster design for some of our campaigns. The freedom to choose any creative direction and later seeing a huge print of your work on the street is just incredibly satisfying to me <br><br><span>3/6 • Poster for an ad campaign direct to college freshmen</span></div>
					
					<div>After seeing how we handled our social media, many clients became interested in giving their own establishments a more professional approach. <br><br>So we started a secondary project to create content and manage some of the restaurant's social media, through on-site-photo shoots, menu and logo re-design and directed marketing campaigns. In August, 2017 we had to hire two interns to keep our client's social media feed updated.<br><br><span>4/6 • Voucher coupon at one of our clients, retrievable only by the App </span></div>

					<div>At the end of 2017 - with 4 team members - we reached the mark of 100 establishments signed to the App and the data feedback continued to surpass our expectations: <br><br>In December we had 15,772 sessions, 102,659 pageviews and 1,732 downloads with an average visit duration of 4 minutes. <br><br><span>5/6 • Monthly data report</span></div>
					
					<div>Although we've always had big plans for Tumpero, in 2018 our priorities became to shift towards moving to Europe, so we had to discontinue the project in September that year. <br><br>To this day, I can honestly say that Tumpero is my proudest achievement.
