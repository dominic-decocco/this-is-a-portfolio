		<h3>Profile</h3>
		<p>
		Bachelor in Economics but passionate
		about Graphic Design. First introduced
		to Photoshop and Illustrator in the early
		days of college. Self-taught and fast learner, 
		I started my own App at 24 and months later reached
		to JavaScript, HTML and CSS in order to enhance it. <br> <br>

		Merging the skills of a designer and front-end developer
		allows me to cover a lot of bases on the client side and places me
		in a privileged position to enjoy the creative process and 
		feel gratified by the problem solving. <br> <br>

		Currently getting involved with React Native and
		3D modeling. Living in Dublin but looking forward
		to <br>moving to Spain or Portugal.  <br> <br>

		Brazilian, 28 years old, can’t settle until <br>
		the perfect font is found. </p>

				<div class="colorbox1">
					<div class="text">In the last year of college, my flatmate and I founded a website gathering all information about our city's restaurant and bars, always highlighting the discounts: June 16th, 2016, Tumpero was live as the first gastronomic city guide. The restaurants would pay a monthly fee in order to be listed and advertised.<br><br>As the user base and affiliated establishments grew quickly, we had to shift to a mobile app in only 6 months <br><br><span>1/5 • Tumpero's Logo and In-App screenshot (Tumpero is a variation of the word 'seasoning' in Portuguese)</span></div>
				</div>
				<div class="colorbox2">
					<div class="text white">A quick and seamless way to make that transition was to use a platform called GoodBarber to create the App. Even though it delivered what we needed to start, our new ideas became limited by the platform's features. <br><br>I had to reach for HTML, CSS and JS in order to tweak and improve Tumpero the way we wanted. A couple of months later, I was splitting my work hours into graphic design and front-end development<span> <br><br>2/5 • List of restaurants</span></div>
				</div>
				<div class="colorbox3">
					<div class="text white">I was in charge of the creative process and its implementation through coding. The branding, logo, the design behind the app and social media content were all under my umbrella. <br><br>However, my absolute passion was the poster design for some of our campaigns. The freedom to decide on any creative direction and later seeing a huge print of your work on the street is just incredibly satisfying to me <br><br><span class="white">3/5 • The deals could be sorted by day of the week</span></div>
				</div>

				<div class="colorbox4">
					<div class="text">At the end of 2017, with four team members, we reached the mark of 100 establishments signed to the App and the data feedback continued to surpass our expectations: <br><br>In December we had 15,772 sessions, 102,659 pageviews and 1,732 downloads with an average visit duration of 4 minutes. <br><br><span>4/5 • Monthly data report</span></div>
				</div>

				<div class="colorbox5">
					<div class="text white">Although we've always had big plans for Tumpero, in 2018 our priorities became to shift towards moving to Europe, so we had to discontinue the project in September that year. <br><br>To this day, I can honestly say that Tumpero is my proudest achievement. The financial return of doing what you love was only smaller than the experience earned by fighting for what you believe in. <br><br>Click <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodbarber.tumpero&hl=en_IE">here</a> to check out the App on Google Store<br><br><span>5/5 • Push notifications about the latest deals</span></div>

					<div class="text_code"><i>I did it my way: </i><br><br>
					To a graphic designer, Portfolio is key. To a graphic designer slash front-end developer, the website <i>is</i> the portfolio. <br><br> My initial thoughts of showcasing the work on Behance were quickly erased by the necessity to make this project as personal as a tooth brush: 100% ahead of the art direction, design process and coding (except for one question on Stackoverflow) <span><br><br>1/4</span></div>
				</div>
				<div class="colorbox2_portfolio">
					<div class="text_code white"><i>Second guessing the stroke weight: </i><br><br>
					Honestly, the biggest challenge I faced was to not have a deadline or client approval, which made me prolong the creation process on Illustrator.<br><br>Inspiration came from two places: the colors and typography from <a href="https://toyfight.co/">Toy Fight</a> and low poly/3d concept from <a href="https://useplink.com/en/">Plink</a>. Once the low poly aesthetic was chosen, the portfolio was put together in a couple of weeks <span> <br><br>2/4</span></div>
				</div>
				<div class="colorbox3_portfolio">
					<div class="text_code white"> <i>Box layout is not my cup of tea: </i><br><br>
					As it's clear on most of my websites, I like to create sections that bleed into the next, so the whole project would tell a story in a natural flow, compelling the user to keep scrolling. I'll separate content into boxes when the client is the government. <br><br>The whole portfolio was made on a single HTML file, for two reasons: as a "story being told", I didn't want the user to step out of it by loading another page and also, there's not that much content to fill two pages <br><br><span class="white">3/4</span></div>
				</div>

				<div class="colorbox4_portfolio">
					<div class="text_code"><i>Nerding out a bit: </i><br><br>
					As this portfolio is basically one big illustration, the hardest part was to create, size and position every single element to fit their specific space and, at the same time, be responsive with only one media query: <i>'To use pixels or viewports? That's the question'. </i><br><br>For the image sliders I reached for a little bit of logic on Jquery and created a couple of handlers, no biggy. <br>Some vanilla JS to trigger section openings and parallax effect for the meteors to roll cool <br><br><span>4/4</span></div>
