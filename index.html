		<h3>Profile</h3>
		<p>
		Bachelor in Economics but passionate
		about Graphic Design. First introduced
		to Photoshop and Illustrator in the early
		days of college. Self-taught and fast learner, 
		I started my own App at 24, and months later reached
		to JavaScript, HTML and CSS in order to enhance it. <br> <br>

		Merging the skills of a designer and front-end developer
		allows me to cover a lot of bases on the client side, and puts me
		in a privileged position to enjoy the creative process and 
		feel gratified by the problem solving. <br> <br>

		Currently getting involved with React Native and
		3D modeling. Living in Dublin but looking foward
		to <br>moving to Spain or Portugal.  <br> <br>

		Brazilian, 28 years old, can’t settle until <br>
		the perfect font is found. </p>
